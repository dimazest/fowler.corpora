``fowler.corpora`` is software to create vector space models for Distributional
Semantics experiments.

It is possible to instantiate a vector space from

* British National Corpus
* Google Books N-gram corpus

The weighting schemes include:

* TF-IDF
* NMF
* PMI

The implemented experiments are:

* Word similarity (wordsim353)
* Dialog act tagging, using the Switchboard corpus http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~dm303/cvsc14.html
* Number of categorical composition experiments
